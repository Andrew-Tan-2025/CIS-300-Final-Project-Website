		<p id="smth">
		<span class="resort">Transistor</span> is an interesting game for me: I don't love it nor hate it, it's somewhere in-between. 
		Transistor represents an in-between shift from the old & new SuperGiant Games, with little/no dialogue and a VERY linear game 
		experience. However, Transistor is still a game that I beleive is worth playing.

		<h2> Gameplay </h2>
		<p>
		<span class="resort">Transistor</span> is an isometric action-adventure game, with the added ability to stop time. 
		The player has up to 4 moves to use, which can all be used in real time. However, stopping time allows you to 
		move freely and use the moves within an allotted time. However, when you begin the execution, everything plays out in real-time, 
		meaning enemies can also move while your planned sequence plays out. This provides a lot of challenge, as you not only have 
		</p>
		<p>
		That's only the beginning though, as your moves can be customized to an insane amount. Throughout the game you'll unlock 
		more moves, which provide more options. However, each move can also be enhanced, with 2 slots to add new behaviors to said 
		move. This customizability and depth is the primary reason why I love Transistor.

			<tr>
				<!-- character blurb -->
				<td> 
				The Subject, is the talking weapon that also stores the moves unlocked. He is the 
				player's bodyguard, who was stabbed by the sword and now inhabits it. He is calm and direct, 
				often guiding the player to new objectives to find a way to escape the dissapearing city and 
				the robots tearing it apart. It seems that the Subject is only fulfilling his bodyguard role, but 
				reading about his character tells a different story. It reveals that the Subject and the protagonist, Red, 
				could possibly be in a romatic relationship. This small detail recontextualizes all of the Subject's 
				actions as a man protecting the love of his life, and I love that it's never overtly stated throughout 
				a majority of the game. 
				</td>
				<td> 
				Asher Kendrell is a member of the Camerata, the big, scary Illuminati group responsible for the city's 
				collapse. Not much is known about the members and their character, but reading the character descriptions 
				can help give some insight. Asher was obsessed with history and the truth, especially with the city's 
				history. When he studied its history, Asher began to notice all the lies and contradictions, which led him 
				to Grant Kendrell, leader of the Camerata. From there, they bonded over their desire for truth, leading to 
				Asher becoming one of the Camerata's members. What makes Asher interesting is his interaction with Grant because 
				of how it is shown to the player. Asher and Grant could genuinely be in love, but there is always this power 
				imbalance between them, with Asher being a reporter and Grant being an administrator. You never quite know what 
				the exact details are to the relationship, and its fun to piece it together.
				</td>
				<td>
				Grant Kendrell is the leader of the Camerata, and one of the city's highest-ranking officials. He begins as the 
				stroy's antagonist, a shadowy figure that could be controlling the robots. However, further reading reveals his 
				true character. Grant created the Camerata to live up to his role as administrator, but also sought to change it. 
				It is the reason why he wanted to create the Transistor(the weapon): Grant wanted to create the ideal world using its 
				power, and Red's voice could help soothe the inhabitants of the ideal world. What I love about his character is that 
				there are two conflicting sides: one side is the ruthless bureaucrat who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, and 
				the idealist who only wishes to create a better world.
