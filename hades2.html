		<h1> Hades II </h1>

		<p id="smth">
		<span class="resort">Hades II</span> is SuperGiant's most recent project to-date, and 
		their first sequel. Though still in development, <span class="resort">Hades II</span> has 
		completely retuned the Hades formula, while still retaining the high-quality character writing 
		& reimagined Greek Mythos that made its predecessor iconic.

		<h2> Gameplay </h2>
		<p>
		Much like its predecessor, Hades II is a roguelite, with godly boons and other perks to collect 
		temporarily on each run. You may also encounter new characters from Greek Mythology, whom you can 
		chat with, give gifts to, and see their story unfold with each visit.
		</p>
		<p>
		However, Hades II is more than just a direct copy: every gameplay aspect mentioned has been either 
		reworked/ completely changed. For instance, each move now has an "Omega move", which is an enhanced 
		version of said move that costs Mana. This slight gamplay alteration shifts away from the fast-paced 
		action of Hades, and more towards a slower, methodical playstyle. Each action must be considerd in a 
		split second, & every omega attack used is vital to your success.
		</p>

				<!-- character blurb -->
				<td> 
					Narcissus is a new side character in <span class="resort">Hades II</span>, 
					and can be found in the second area of the Tartarus route. Much like his Mythology counterpart, 
					Narcissus is beautiful, completely self-absorbed and in-love with himself. However, this part of his character 
					is given more dimension: because he is beautiful, he has no concept of a strictly platonic relationship. 
					When the player first encounters him, he attempts to brush you away, assuming Melinoe wants him. 
					What I love about Narcissus is how he learns to be empathetic, by learning how his actions can have 
					unintended consequences, and that relationships with people don't need to be romantic in-nature, that it's 
					okay to just have a good friend.
				</td>
				<td> 
					Hecate is the parental guardian in <span class="resort">Hades II</span>, and 
					is responsible for raising Melinoe, the protagonist. She is very similar to Nyx 
					on the surface, with a calm demeanor & nurturing nature towards Melinoe. However, they could 
					not be further apart: while Nyx accepted her surrogate son's love, Hecate does not believe she 
					is deserving of Melinoe's love. She was tasked to protect Hades's daughter, and only sees her as 
					the key to stopping Chronos. Her journey, though incomplete, shows how Hecate is deserving of a 
					motherly love for all her hard work & dedication, even if she doesn't believe so herself.
				</td>
				<td> 
					Icarus is a new side character in <span class="resort">Hades II</span>, 
					and can be found in the second area of the Tartarus route. He was revived by Melinoe, who 
					took pity on his situation, and now serves to aid the war effort against Chronos while donning 
					the wings that made him iconic in Greek Mythology. What I love about this caharacter is his 
					relatable self-doubt. He believes that he could never amount to much because of his father's 
					achievements, even though he is a master craftsman in his own right. Though not completed, Icarus's 
					story is headed in the direction that will, hopefully, allow Icarus to see that he is more than 
					enough.
