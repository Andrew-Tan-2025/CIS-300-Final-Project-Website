		<h1>Hades</h1>
		
		<p>
		<span class="resort">Hades</span> is SuperGiant's most well-known titles, and 
		is the first game I officially got into. While not the most innovative mechanically,
		Hades makes it's mark by having fantastic dialogue & character writing, creating its 
		own interpretation on Greek Mythology.

		<h2> Gameplay </h2>
		<p>
		Hades is a roguelite, a subgenre of roguelike games that allows for some level of 
		permanent progression. The permanent progression takes the form of the Mirror of Night, which offers 
		stat upgrades & new abilities(second dash, more lives per run, etc.), and the permanent upgrades to the 
		weapons, of which there are 6 categories with 4 variants per. Each run consists of entering & clearing a 
		number of chambers, which offer a small reward/weapon upgrades/boons, which culminates to a Boss fight. 
		This loop repeats for 4 areas, each with a new set of enemies & hazards.
		</p>
		<p>
		While the implementation of roguelike mechanics(i.e. restart from 
		beginning, select buffs acquired in a given run, etc.) are not unique, 
		the progression of the main story & other character's stories is what makes Hades unique 
		among roguelikes. The story and its many threads advance at different speeds, all dependent 
		on your progression through the game, which in turn creates a wholly unique experience for 
		every player. In addition, the player is able to interact with & gift a wild assortment of side 
		characters, all from Greek Mythology and each with their own compelling story & unique twist from their 
		mythological counterparts.

				<!-- character blurb -->
				<td> 
					The son of Hades, Zagreus is the prince of hell and the 
					protagonist of <span class="resort">Hades</span>. Zagreus is a lovable & earnest idiot, 
					who cannot help but involve himself in other people's problems. 
					Zagreus's commitment to other people's problems is why he is my 
					favorite characters in <span class="resort">Hades</span>.
				</td>
				<td> 
					Nyx is the "mother" of Zagreus, and an ally to his quest. She offers 
					the Mirror of Night, which offers perma-upgrades, and reaches out to 
					the Olympian Gods & Goddesses to aid Zagreus. Despite her stoic exterior, 
					Nyx does truly care about Zagreus & openly loves him in her own way, which 
					is why she is one of my favorites. She accepted the responsibility of 
					raising Zagreus, and accepts him as her own.
				</td>
				<td>
					Initially a rival to Zagreus, Thanatos occasionally appears to 
					challenge Zagreus to see who is better. Like his mother Nyx, Thanatos is a 
					stoic character, but over time a softer, more reserved version 
					is revealed: Thanatos only acts as an obstacle to Zagreus's journey because he is 
					afraid that Zagreus, when he meets his family, will leave his Cthonic family behind. 
					He also gives you a bat plush, which is also nice.
