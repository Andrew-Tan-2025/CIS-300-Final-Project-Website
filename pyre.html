		<h1> Pyre </h1>

		<p id="smth">
		<span class="resort">Pyre</span> is, unfortunately, the game I have spent least amount of time with. Although I have played so little, 
		I still enjoy this game for its unique spin on the sports games genre, and the fun & interesting characters taht you will meet on your 
		journey to freedom.

		<h2> Gameplay </h2>
		<p>
		A majority of the game does not take place in an arena, but in the overworld. You start with the option to select 
		one of several locations, each having some potnetial reward. After the selection is made, you are able to purchase/sell 
		items, read about the lore of the land, or practice for the Rite, the sports-like event that marks the end of a journey.
		</p>
		<p>
		The goal of the Rites is simple: carry/shoot the orb into the enemy's goal until their flame's health reaches 0. You are 
		permitted 3 of your band of characters to participate in the Rite, but you are only allowed to control 1 of them at a time. 
		Each character projects an aura, a danger zone that kills any player that touches it, which can be increased in size when 
		standing inside a teammate's aura OR cast out as a projectile. Each character species determines the aura size, cast method, 
		aura projection, etc. <span class="resort">Pyre</span>'s gameplay, while not as fast-paced as other sports games, is somehow
		a tense & exhilirating experience. The small gameplay changes emphasize the importance of positioning & team composition, and 
		every teammate death means the enemy has the chance to score. The ability to construct a team and strategy, alongside the 
		moment-to-moment plays that define sports games, is why I enjoy Pyre.

				<!-- character blurb -->
				<td> 
				Jodariel is the muscle & protector of the group, who also steers the group out of danger with her knowledge of the Downside. 
				This protector role she plays is also reflected in her gameplay, as she casts the largest aura of any character, with the capacity 
				to shoot a large projectile capable of catching any unsuspecitng contestant with ease. However, what I really love about Jodariel is 
				her backstory: Jodariel has been in the Downside longer than anyone in the Nightwings, and you spark that small hope of her being able 
				to be set free from the Rites. Both the player and Jodi bring something to the table, and you both become a fiery force to save your 
				group from the Downside.
				</td>
				<td>
				The former Reader to the Nightwings, Sandalwood serves as a mentor to the player & the master to a greater plan 
				he has in store for the participants in the Rites. He starts as an untrustworthy ally, joining much later into the 
				game & only the Bard to vouch for him. When he joined the party, I did not trust him at all. As the game progressed, 
				however, I began to change my perspective on him. Before he was banished to the Downside, Sandalwood operated a printing 
				press, and would spend his time printing, reading, & distributing books. For this offense he was banished, and his goal 
				is to see everyone liberated from the Rites, by sending everyone back. It was at this moment that I loved this character: 
				Sandalwood had slowly earned my trust by confiding in the team, and his altruistic & ambitious goal to see everyone free made 
				him an admirable character.
				</td>
				<td>
				I love Ti'zo because he is the cute mascot character. He starts out with the group & is the lovable imp that makes cute chirping
				noises with a hint of a sassy personality. He's like if a bat inherited a cat's temperament, and I love him for that.
